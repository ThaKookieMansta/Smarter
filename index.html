        <h1>About the project</h1>
        <p>
          You may ask, "Why did you choose to make an e-learning platform?" The
          answer is simple. We believe that knowledge is not just power; it's a
          universal right. The decision to create a free e-learning platform
          stems from a deep-seated commitment to breaking down the barriers that
          hinder access to education, particularly in Africa.
        </p>
        <p>Here is a deeper look at our reasoning behind Smarter</p>
        <ul class="benefits">
          <li>
            We want to make sure that every person, regardless of their
            background, has a shot at a great education. By offering our
            e-learning platform for free, we're breaking down the barriers that
            often keep people from reaching their full potential.
          </li>
          <li>
            Africa is bursting with talent, but sometimes it goes unnoticed. Our
            platform is here to help individuals unearth their hidden strengths,
            giving them the chance to shine and contribute to their communities
            and the continent.
          </li>
          <li>
            Learning isn't just about facts and figures – it's a spark for
            creativity. Our free resources are designed to inspire imaginative
            thinking and problem-solving. We believe that unleashing creativity
            isn't just good for personal growth; it's essential for Africa's
            development.
          </li>
          <li>
            Everyone deserves the chance to learn skills that will help them
            thrive. Our platform focuses on practical knowledge that's relevant
            in today's world, contributing to a workforce that's not just
            skilled but ready to drive positive change.
          </li>
          <li>
            Traditional education systems sometimes struggle to reach everyone,
            especially in remote areas. Our online platform overcomes these
            challenges, bringing quality education to even the most far-flung
            corners of Africa. We're determined to ensure that no one misses
            out.
          </li>
          <li>
            Life can be hectic, and traditional learning might not fit
            everyone's schedule. Our e-learning platform is all about
            flexibility – study when and where it suits you. It's education that
            adapts to your life, not the other way around.
          </li>
          <li>
            Education should know no borders. By providing free access to our
            platform, we're not just opening doors within Africa; we're
            connecting learners to a global community. It's a chance to learn
            from others, share experiences, and build a broader perspective.
